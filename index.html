      <h2>About Myself</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Kiryl Zenevich, I am a student with a good background in both
        art and science. I had been making music for 6 years by mixing different
        sounds to create unique tracks, I just loved it and I did it for myself
        and my friends when it wasn't popular yet. In addition to making music,
        I have seven years of experience in Photoshop, where I enhanced,
        retouched, and transformed everything that came into my frame. My
        experience as a photographer allows me to capture moments with keen
        attention to detail and composition. For four years I studied at the
        Minsk State College of Architecture and Civil Engineering, which gave me
        a solid technical training. I am currently studying engineering at the
        Gdańsk Higher School. My passion for remote work, art and interest in
        exact sciences pushes me to become a front-end developer. I believe that
        my diverse skill set is a good fit for me in this career.
