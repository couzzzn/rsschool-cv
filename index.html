        <p>
          My name is Kiryl Zenevich.<br />
          I am a student with a good background in both art and science. I had
          been making music for 6 years by mixing different sounds to create
          unique tracks, because I just loved it and I did it for myself when it
          wasn't popular yet.<br />
          In addition to making music, I have seven years of experience in
          Photoshop, where I enhanced, retouched, and transformed everything
          that came into my frame. My experience as a photographer allows me to
          capture moments with keen attention to detail and composition.<br />
          For four years I studied at the Minsk State College of Architecture
          and Civil Engineering, which gave me a solid technical training. I am
          currently studying engineering at the Gdańsk Higher School.<br />
          My passion for remote work, art and interest in exact sciences pushes
          me to become a front-end developer. I believe that my diverse skill
          set is a good fit for me in this career.

          PROBLEM: For each purchase, we add a fixed amount of 50 bonus points
          to your balance. Points expire over time - 3 points expire every day.
          Calculate what balance the user will have after 7 days if he usually
          makes a purchase every two days. (The first purchase is made on
          Tuesday). Calculate how much will be on your balance after 7 days.
          Display the user's balance on the screen.
