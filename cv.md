#### About Myself:

My name is Kiryl Zenevich, I am a student with a good background in both art and science.

I had been making music for 6 years by mixing different sounds to create unique tracks, I just loved it and I did it for myself and my friends when it wasn't popular yet.     
In addition to making music, I have seven years of experience in Photoshop, where I enhanced, retouched, and transformed everything that came into my frame. My experience as a photographer allows me to capture moments with keen attention to detail and composition.

For four years I studied at the Minsk State College of Architecture and Civil Engineering, which gave me a solid technical training. I am currently studying engineering at the Gdańsk Higher School.  

My passion for remote work, art and interest in exact sciences pushes me to become a front-end developer. I believe that my diverse skill set is a good fit for me in this career.
